**Salary Data Analysis Project Overview**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of salary data across various industries and locations. Using Python, I applied advanced data manipulation techniques with Pandas and NumPy, along with statistical visualizations through Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project involved creating a detailed dataset encompassing multiple factors such as age, occupation, salary, experience, and educational background for professionals in different cities worldwide.

**Key Highlights:**

**Data Wrangling and Transformation:** Processed and cleaned raw data, converting it into a structured format suitable for analysis.
**Statistical Analysis:** Calculated key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for salaries, enabling a deeper understanding of salary distribution.
**Visualization:** Developed insightful visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and pivot tables, to present the data's findings effectively.
**Country and City-Wise Salary Comparisons:** Analyzed average salaries by country and city, highlighting trends and disparities across different regions.
